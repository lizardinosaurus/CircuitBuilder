# CircuitBuilder


## Description

### overview

This project aims at allowing visual circuits to be built in an easy way by just dragging and dropping components and connecting them with wires. The circuit builder can also be used to simulate current and component voltage in circuits


### how to use
Run the circuit builder.py file, the database file already comes with an example circuit to try out but if you want to start over you can click the delete all button which will remove everything. In order to build a circuit you just drag the components form the tray holding left click and to connect wires and set values you just right click on the components which opens a dropdown menu. To run a circuit just click the green play button in the top right of the window.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* make sure to install all the libraries in the requirements.txt file
* this program was made on windows 11

### Installing and executing

* The program runs from the CircuitBuilder.py file and requires the circuitdata.db file and the assets folder
* The circuitdata.db file uploaded comes with an example circuit but if you need a new file you can create one by running Initialise.py
